# Keystrokes*

Records keystrokes and timestamps in a .csv file in the same folder as the file you are typing in.

Note we are currently working on detecting keystroke patterns. This version will reward typing the # sign

Make sure to save the file before starting to record keystrokes in order to ensure the keystrokes will be recorded into the .csv file, which will be titled "keystrokes.csv" -- if there is already a "keystrokes.csv" in the folder directory, it will be appended to the current file. If not, it will create the file automatically.
